         Country History
        </h2>
        <p>
            <em>Egypt</em> has one of the longest histories of any country,
             tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to
              the 6th–4th millennia BCE. 
              Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient <em>Egypt</em>  saw 
              some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture,
               urbanisation, organised religion and central government.
             Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, 
             as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings,
              reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. <em>Egypt</em> 
              's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, 
              which reflects its unique transcontinental location being all Mediterranean, 
              Middle Eastern and North African.<em>Egypt</em>  was an early and important centre of Christianity, 
              but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, 
              albeit with a significant Christian minority.
